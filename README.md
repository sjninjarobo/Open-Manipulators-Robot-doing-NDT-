Ultrasonic imaging of a metallic test object using a robotic platform was my dissertation project in the final year of MTech at IISc Bangalore.
# Background
A nondestructive test can be defined as testing the physical properties of an object without
destroying the future usefulness of the test object.NDT is primarily used in industrial setups
to detect flaws, cracks, fracture defects, and voids in materials used to build aeroplanes, power
plants, bridges, etc. A nondestructive test evaluates an energy/defect interaction
which is accomplished by applying pulsed energy in the form of ultrasound to the test object.
The presence of flaws is inferred from the received reflected ultrasonic pulses from the test
specimen. X-rays are also prevalent for NDT testing
# Ultrasonic Imaging: A-Scan, B-Scan and C-Scan
Ultrasonic data can be collected and displayed in several different formats. The three most
common formats are known in the NDT world as A-scan, B-scan and C-scan presentations. Each
presentation mode provides a different way of looking at and evaluating the region of material
being inspected.
The A-scan presentation displays the amount of received ultrasonic energy as a function of
time. The relative amount of received energy is plotted along the vertical axis and the elapsed
time (which may be related to the sound energy travel time within the material) is displayed
along the horizontal axis.
The B-scan presentation is a profile (cross-sectional) view of the test specimen. In the B-scan,
the time-of-flight (travel time) of the sound energy is displayed along the vertical axis and
the linear position of the transducer is displayed along the horizontal axis. From the B-scan,
the depth of the reflector and its approximate linear dimensions in the scan direction can be
determined.
The C-scan presentation provides a plan-type view of the location and size of test specimen
features. The plane of the image is parallel to the scan pattern of the transducer. C-scan
presentations are produced with an automated data acquisition system, such as a computer-controlled immersion scanning system
